# Character Config Service Documentation

## Overview

The **Character Config Service** is the centralized configuration management system that maintains character prompts, personality settings, and behavioral parameters for Peter, Brian, and Stewie Griffin. It serves as the source of truth for character authenticity and provides optimized prompts with intelligent caching.

## Service Details

- **Container Name**: `character-config`
- **Port**: `6006`
- **Workers**: `1` (single-worker for reliability)
- **Dependencies**: KeyDB (caching only)
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:6006/health`

## Prompt Optimization Engine

### Context-Aware Enhancement

```python
def optimize_prompt_for_context(character, base_prompt, context):
    """Optimize character prompt based on conversation context"""
    
    topic = context.get('topic', 'general')
    tone = context.get('conversation_tone', 'casual')
    user_input = context.get('user_input', '')
    
    # Get character configuration
    char_config = get_character_config(character)
    
    # Apply topic-specific optimizations
    if topic in char_config['topic_responses']:
        topic_config = char_config['topic_responses'][topic]
        
        if topic_config['enthusiasm'] > 0.8:
            base_prompt += f" Show high enthusiasm about {topic}."
        if topic_config['knowledge'] > 0.7:
            base_prompt += f" Display expertise in {topic}."
    
    # Apply tone adjustments
    if tone == 'intellectual' and character == 'brian':
        base_prompt += " Use sophisticated vocabulary and make intellectual references."
    elif tone == 'casual' and character == 'peter':
        base_prompt += " Keep language simple and enthusiastic."
    
    # Apply character-specific user input analysis
    user_topics = extract_topics_from_input(user_input)
    for user_topic in user_topics:
        if user_topic in char_config['topic_responses']:
            response_style = char_config['topic_responses'][user_topic]
            base_prompt += f" React to {user_topic} with {response_style} level interest."
    
    return base_prompt
```

### Performance-Based Optimization

```python
def apply_performance_optimizations(character, prompt, performance_history):
    """Apply optimizations based on historical performance"""
    
    # Analyze recent performance patterns
    recent_failures = get_recent_failures(character, performance_history)
    successful_patterns = get_successful_patterns(character, performance_history)
    
    # Apply failure-prevention optimizations
    for failure in recent_failures:
        if failure['type'] == 'formal_language':
            prompt += f" Avoid formal language. Never use phrases like {', '.join(get_character_forbidden_phrases(character))}."
        elif failure['type'] == 'poor_authenticity':
            prompt += f" Use characteristic expressions: {', '.join(get_character_signature_phrases(character))}."
        elif failure['type'] == 'low_engagement':
            prompt += " Be more engaging and enthusiastic in your response."
    
    # Apply successful pattern reinforcement
    for pattern in successful_patterns:
        if pattern['type'] == 'high_authenticity':
            prompt += f" Continue using authentic {character} expressions and vocabulary."
        elif pattern['type'] == 'good_engagement':
            prompt += " Maintain the engaging tone that has been working well."
    
    return prompt
```

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Service Configuration
CHARACTER_CONFIG_PORT=6006
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Cache Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://keydb:6379
CHARACTER_CONFIG_CACHE_TTL=86400
PROMPT_CACHE_TTL=3600

# Character Settings
PETER_ENTHUSIASM_MULTIPLIER=1.2
BRIAN_INTELLECTUAL_BOOST=1.1
STEWIE_SUPERIORITY_EMPHASIS=1.3

# Optimization Settings
CONTEXT_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED=true
PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED=true
TOPIC_ENHANCEMENT_ENABLED=true
```

### Dynamic Configuration Updates

```python
def update_character_config(character, config_updates):
    """Update character configuration dynamically"""
    
    current_config = get_character_config(character)
    
    # Validate updates
    if validate_config_updates(config_updates):
        # Apply updates
        updated_config = merge_config_updates(current_config, config_updates)
        
        # Update cache
        cache_character_config(character, updated_config)
        
        # Log configuration change
        log_config_change(character, config_updates)
        
        return True
    else:
        raise InvalidConfigurationError("Configuration updates failed validation")
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- **Character Configs**: 24-hour TTL for base configurations
- **Optimized Prompts**: 1-hour TTL for context-specific prompts  
- **Character Traits**: 24-hour TTL for trait definitions
- **Validation Results**: 30-minute TTL for response validations

### Response Time Optimization
```python
# Typical response times
response_times = {
    'base_prompt_retrieval': '0.001-0.005 seconds',
    'optimized_prompt_generation': '0.010-0.050 seconds',
    'character_validation': '0.005-0.020 seconds',
    'trait_analysis': '0.002-0.010 seconds'
}
```

## Integration Points

### Message Router Integration
- Primary consumer for character prompts
- Receives optimized prompts for LLM generation
- Provides character validation feedback

### Fine Tuning Integration
- Supplies base prompts for optimization
- Receives performance feedback for improvements
- Supports prompt enhancement requests

### LLM Service Integration
- Provides generation settings with prompts
- Supplies character-specific parameters
- Offers validation for generated responses

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Configuration Monitoring
```bash
# Check character config health
curl http://localhost:6006/health | jq '.characters'

# Monitor cache performance
curl http://localhost:6006/health | jq '.cache_stats'

# Check character-specific requests
docker logs character-config | grep "character: peter"
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor prompt optimization
docker logs character-config | grep "optimized_prompt"

# Check validation accuracy
docker logs character-config | grep "validation_passed"

# Monitor cache hit rates
curl http://localhost:6006/health | jq '.cache_stats.hit_rate'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Character Authenticity Problems**
```bash
# Check character trait definitions
curl http://localhost:6006/character_traits/peter | jq '.core_traits'

# Review forbidden phrases
curl http://localhost:6006/llm_prompt/peter | jq '.forbidden_phrases'

# Monitor validation failures
docker logs character-config | grep "validation_failed"
```

#### **Poor Prompt Performance**
```bash
# Check optimization settings
docker logs character-config | grep "optimization_applied"

# Monitor context enhancement
docker logs character-config | grep "context_enhancements"

# Review generation settings
curl http://localhost:6006/llm_prompt/brian | jq '.generation_settings'
```

## Development

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start service with dependencies
docker-compose up character-config keydb

# Test character prompt retrieval
curl http://localhost:6006/llm_prompt/peter

# Test optimized prompt generation
curl -X POST http://localhost:6006/optimized_prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "character": "stewie",
    "context": {"topic": "science"}
  }'

# Monitor logs
docker logs -f character-config
```

### Adding New Characters
1. Define character configuration in character definitions
2. Add personality traits and behavioral parameters
3. Configure speaking patterns and forbidden phrases
4. Test prompt generation and validation
5. Update service integration points

## Security & Privacy

- **Configuration Security**: Character configs stored locally
- **Input Validation**: All requests validated before processing
- **No External Dependencies**: Self-contained configuration system
- **Cache Security**: Sensitive data with appropriate TTL
