### **Character Selection Algorithm**
```python
def select_character_for_organic_conversation():
    """
    Weighted selection based on personality traits and recent activity
    """
    characters = {
        'peter': {
            'probability': 0.5,
            'last_organic': get_last_organic_time('peter'),
            'recent_activity': get_recent_activity('peter')
        },
        'brian': {
            'probability': 0.3,

            'recent_activity': get_recent_activity('stewie')
        }
    }
    
    # Adjust probabilities based on recent activity
    # Characters who haven't spoken recently get higher probability
    adjusted_weights = adjust_for_recent_activity(characters)
    
    return weighted_random_selection(adjusted_weights)
```

## üß† Dynamic Conversation Generation

### **LLM-Generated Starters**
Instead of static conversation starters, the Orchestrator dynamically generates authentic character responses:

#### **Generation Process**
1. **Character Context**: Selects character with personality traits and recent topics
2. **RAG Enhancement**: Retrieves relevant Family Guy knowledge for inspiration
3. **LLM Prompting**: Creates character-specific prompt with authentic voice requirements
4. **Quality Validation**: Ensures response meets character authenticity standards
5. **Delivery**: Sends to appropriate Discord handler for posting

#### **Example Generation Prompts**
```python
# Peter Griffin Starter Generation
PETER_STARTER_PROMPT = """
You are Peter Griffin from Family Guy. Generate a conversation starter that:
- Uses simple, enthusiastic language
- Starts with "Holy crap!" or "Oh man!" 
- References something about food, TV, beer, work, or family
- Is 1-2 sentences maximum
- Sounds like something Peter would randomly bring up
- Incorporates this context if relevant: {rag_context}

Generate a natural conversation starter Peter would say:
"""

# Brian Griffin Starter Generation  
BRIAN_STARTER_PROMPT = """
You are Brian Griffin from Family Guy. Generate a conversation starter that:
- Uses intellectual, articulate language
- References literature, politics, philosophy, or culture
- Sounds slightly pretentious but thoughtful
- Is 2-3 sentences maximum
- Could start with "Well, actually..." or similar
- Incorporates this context if relevant: {rag_context}

Generate a conversation starter Brian would naturally bring up:
"""

# Stewie Griffin Starter Generation
STEWIE_STARTER_PROMPT = """
You are Stewie Griffin from Family Guy. Generate a conversation starter that:
- Uses sophisticated, condescending language
- References science, technology, or intelligence
- Sounds superior and dismissive of others
- Could mention plans or schemes
- Starts with "Good Lord..." or "Blast!" or similar
- Incorporates this context if relevant: {rag_context}

Generate a conversation starter Stewie would condescendingly bring up:
"""
```

#### **RAG Context Integration**
The system incorporates Family Guy knowledge to make starters more authentic:
```python
def generate_conversation_starter(character: str) -> str:
    # Get character-specific topics and traits
    traits = get_character_traits(character)
    
    # Retrieve relevant Family Guy context
    rag_context = rag_retriever.get_context(
        query=f"{character} {random.choice(traits['topics'])}",
        num_results=2
    )
    
    # Generate dynamic starter with LLM
    starter = llm_service.generate_response(
        prompt=get_character_starter_prompt(character),
        context=rag_context,
        character_name=character
    )
    
    return starter
```

## ‚ö° Intelligent Triggering System

### **Background Monitoring**
```python
class OrganicConversationMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.monitoring_interval = 60  # Check every minute
        self.silence_threshold = 15    # 15 minutes
        self.min_time_between = 5      # 5 minutes minimum
        self.trigger_probability = 0.4  # 40% chance
    
    def should_trigger_conversation(self) -> bool:
        # Check if enough time has passed since last organic conversation
        if not self._minimum_time_elapsed():
            return False
            
        # Check if channel has been silent long enough
        if not self._silence_threshold_met():
            return False
            
        # Apply probability factor
        return random.random() < self.trigger_probability
    
    def _minimum_time_elapsed(self) -> bool:
        last_organic = self.get_last_organic_time()
        return (datetime.now() - last_organic).total_seconds() >= (self.min_time_between * 60)
    
    def _silence_threshold_met(self) -> bool:
        last_message = self.get_last_channel_activity()
        return (datetime.now() - last_message).total_seconds() >= (self.silence_threshold * 60)
```

### **Configuration Options**
```bash
# Timing Controls
MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_ORGANIC_CONVERSATIONS=5     # minutes between organic attempts
CONVERSATION_SILENCE_THRESHOLD_MINUTES=15    # silence required before triggering
ORGANIC_CONVERSATION_PROBABILITY=0.4         # 40% probability when conditions met

# Character Weights (optional - uses defaults if not set)
PETER_INITIATION_PROBABILITY=0.5             # 50% selection weight
BRIAN_INITIATION_PROBABILITY=0.3             # 30% selection weight  
STEWIE_INITIATION_PROBABILITY=0.4            # 40% selection weight

# Performance Settings
ORCHESTRATOR_MONITORING_INTERVAL=60          # seconds between checks
ORCHESTRATOR_CACHE_TTL=3600                  # 1 hour cache for activity data

## üîÑ Follow-up Response System

### **Content Analysis for Triggers**
The system analyzes every bot response for content that would naturally trigger other characters:

#### **Character-Specific Triggers**
```python
TRIGGER_PATTERNS = {
    'peter_triggers': {
        'brian_responses': [
            'food', 'beer', 'simple topics', 'crude humor', 
            'TV shows', 'work complaints', 'family drama'
        ],
        'stewie_responses': [
            'stupidity', 'simple thinking', 'obliviousness',
            'family situations', 'parental behavior'
        ]
    },
    'brian_triggers': {
        'peter_responses': [
            'intellectual topics', 'politics', 'literature',
            'philosophy', 'pretentious comments', 'corrections'
        ],
        'stewie_responses': [
            'intellectual competition', 'writing', 'culture',
            'sophistication', 'liberal views'
        ]
    },
    'stewie_triggers': {
        'peter_responses': [
            'intelligence', 'science', 'technology', 'plans',
            'superiority', 'condescension', 'schemes'
        ],
        'brian_responses': [
            'intellectual rivalry', 'science vs literature',
            'competing sophistication', 'one-upmanship'
        ]
    }
}
```

#### **Follow-up Generation Process**
```python

            # Send follow-up with random delay (2-8 seconds)
            delay = random.uniform(2, 8)
            await asyncio.sleep(delay)

    potential_responders = [char for char in ['peter', 'brian', 'stewie'] 
                          if char != original_character]
    
    for character in potential_responders:

                'strength': trigger_strength,
                'keywords': extract_trigger_keywords(message, character),
                'response_type': determine_response_type(original_character, character)

## üéØ Example Conversation Flows

### **Organic Conversation Initiation**
```
[Background Monitor] - Detects 20 minutes of silence
[Trigger Analysis] - Conditions met, 40% probability triggered
[Character Selection] - Peter selected (50% weight, low recent activity)
[RAG Context] - "beer brewing, Pawtucket Patriot Ale, bar scenes"
[LLM Generation] - "Holy crap! You know what I just realized about chicken fighting?"
[Discord Delivery] - Peter posts message

[3 seconds later - Follow-up Analysis]
[Trigger Detection] - "chicken fighting" triggers Brian (intellectual response)
[Character Selection] - Brian chosen for follow-up (60% probability)
[LLM Generation] - "Actually, the anthropology of ritualized combat is fascinating..."
[Discord Delivery] - Brian posts follow-up

[5 seconds later - Another Follow-up]
[Trigger Detection] - "anthropology" triggers Stewie (competitive intelligence)
[Character Selection] - Stewie chosen for follow-up (60% probability)  
[LLM Generation] - "Blast! Your pedestrian analysis lacks any real sophistication..."
[Discord Delivery] - Stewie posts follow-up
```

### **User-Triggered Follow-up Chain**
```
User: "@Peter what's your favorite beer?"
Peter: "Hehehe, Pawtucket Patriot Ale is the best beer ever!"

[3 seconds later - Follow-up Analysis]
[Trigger Detection] - "beer" + "Pawtucket" triggers Brian (cultural commentary)
Brian: "Well, actually, the brewing process reflects working-class American culture..."

[4 seconds later - Another Follow-up]
[Trigger Detection] - "working-class" triggers Stewie (condescending response)
Stewie: "Good Lord, your pedestrian beverage preferences are astounding..."
```
