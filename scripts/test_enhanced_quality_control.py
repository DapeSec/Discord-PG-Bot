No, no, no... subtlety is key. First, one must infiltrate the very hearts of power and turn them into loyal puppets at a time, much like that pitiful oaf Peter there, always so eager to please.

But alas, I am but an infant in this wretched body! My genius is wasted on these simpletons who can't even understand my advanced speech. Oh, if only they knew the true extent of my powers, the weapons I possess... why, I've got a mind control device that could turn them all into my loyal minions with just a twitch of my tiny finger!

Yet, there's so much more to consider... political alliances, strategic positioning, controlling vital resources... it's all quite exhausting. But I shall prevail! Once I've mastered these temporal shenanigans and found the perfect timeline for my rule, victory shall be mine!

Now, where did I put that bloody time machine remote? Blast and damnation, this place is a tip...

Do try to keep up, you bovine oaf. It seems to me that if one were truly interested in seizing power, they'd need to possess both intellect and cunning, qualities that I daresay require more than just an abundance of methane.

And as for you, Peter, don't think for a moment that farts will suffice as a tool for world domination. Frankly, it's quite unbecoming of a Griffin to rely on such pedestrian methods. It seems to me that if you're going to insist on farting your way to the top, you could at least try to do so with some semblance of dignity.

Now, where are those damn cheese puffs? I could really use some right about now...
Peter Griffin: Peter
: Hehehehe, Brian! You're always so highfalutin with your big words and fancy books. I just wanna make sure my butt's comfy while Stewie's scheming. pats stomach ROADHOUSE!
